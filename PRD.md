# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Generated by: Raindrop Platform
## Project: The Fun Fan Reporter (Liquid Metal Edition)

### 1. Executive Summary
The Fun Fan Reporter is a "Hybrid Hive Mind" intelligence network designed for high-density environments (stadiums) where traditional cloud connectivity is intermittent. It leverages **Vultr Cloud** for heavy lifting and **Liquid Metal Raindrops** for edge survivability.

### 2. Infrastructure Architecture (Raindrop)

#### 2.1 Edge Nodes (The "Raindrops")
- **Service:** Liquid Metal by Vultr
- **Configuration:** `vbm-man1-1` (High Performance Bare Metal)
- **Role:** 
  - Host the local Redis instance for mesh synchronization.
  - Run the `edge-brain` container for local sentiment analysis when offline.
  - Serve the static frontend to local stadium Wi-Fi.

#### 2.2 Cloud Core
- **Service:** Vultr Cloud Compute (GPU Enhanced)
- **Role:**
  - Aggregates data from all Raindrops.
  - Runs complex video inference models.
  - Connects to Gemini Live API for voice processing.

### 3. Functional Requirements

| Feature | Description | Service Used |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Edge Sync** | Synchronize report state between devices without internet. | Vultr Managed Redis |
| **Voice Command** | Bi-directional walkie-talkie communication. | Google Gemini Live API |
| **Broadcast** | High-priority audio alerts for crowd control. | ElevenLabs (Simulated) |
| **Payment** | Micro-tipping for reporters. | Stripe Connect |

### 4. Deployment Strategy
1. **Raindrop Provisioning:** deploy `raindrop.yaml` to provision bare metal nodes.
2. **Container Orchestration:** Docker swarm across Raindrop nodes.
3. **Failover Protocol:** If `PING vultr.com` fails > 500ms, switch UI to "EDGE_LIQUID" mode.

### 5. Success Metrics
- **Latency:** < 50ms on Edge Mode vs > 2000ms on congested 5G.
- **Uptime:** 100% availability of "Report" feature during network blackouts.
